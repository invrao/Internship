       " 'Among Bugatti’s recently debuted vehicles, the Divo is a staff favorite. Though it shares much in common with its cheaper (!) sibling the Chiron, the Divo has a lot going for it to justify the extra money. By adding lighter wheels, a carbon fiber intercooler and removing some sound deadening, Bugatti made the Divo 77 pounds lighter than the Chiron. Though power is unchanged from the Chiron’s 1,500 ponies (1,119 kilowatts), The Divo features a different aerodynamic setup, which makes it 8 seconds quicker around the Nardo test track. Finally, the moment you’ve been waiting for: Bugatti is making 40 examples of the car, each costing $5.8 million.',\n",

With a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V10, the base SP Automotive Chaos is one of the most expensive cars on this list – beating out many Lambos and Bugattis – but there's an even pricier version of this car that costs an eye-watering $14.4 million.

Inspired by 1960s Italian coachbuilding, the stunning exterior and steampunk-esque interior – while equally stunning – are only part of what makes this Pagani so pricey. Under the hood is a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 producing 829 horsepower and 809 pound-feet of torque, paired to a seven-speed sequential transmission for a real race-car–like feel. The cost for this one-of-five Pagani is $7.4 million.',\n",

Mercedes built the Exelero on the bones of a Maybach, and gave it the same twin-turbo V12 engine producing 690 horsepower (510 kilowatts) and 752 pound-feet (1,020 Newton-meters) of torque. Top speed is listed at 218 miles per hour (350 kilometers per hour) and adjusted for inflation, the Exelero would cost more than $10 million in today's money.\",\n",

Limited to just 10 – dieci – units, the car is a modern throwback to the Bugatti EB110. At the same time, it’s meant to celebrate Bugatti’s momentous 110-year anniversary.
